# taufik-portfolio

Personal portfolio and project showcase for Taufik Hamid, plus a small owner-only CMS and a bilingual "Vision for Malaysia" planning section.

Live: https://taufik.vercel.app

Stack: Next.js 16.3 (App Router, Server Actions) + React 18 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind CSS 3, backed by Supabase (Postgres with Row Level Security, Auth). Deployed on Vercel. Requires Node >= 24 (`engines` in `package.json`).

## What's in it

- **Public home page** (`app/page.tsx`) — hero, contact links, and project cards read from Supabase `public.projects`. Featured projects are shown as highlights; the rest are collapsed behind "View all projects".
- **Admin CMS** (`/admin`) — CRUD for project cards, sprint/task planning (`/admin/sprints`), moderation of community idea submissions (`/admin/submissions`), and a one-click Bahasa Malaysia backfill (`/admin/translations`). Reads are public; writes are gated to a single owner email. `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `lib/auth.ts` is the app-level check (`requireOwner()` runs at the top of every mutating Server Action) and the same email is hardcoded into every "Admin can write ..." RLS policy in `supabase/migrations/`, so the app and the database cannot drift apart. Login is at `/login` (email/password or Google via Supabase Auth); password reset lives under `app/auth/`.
- **Vision** (`/vision`, Malay at `/ms/vision`) — public planning pages that map Malaysian government ministries to problems and software ideas. Anyone can submit an idea (anonymous, honeypot-protected, stored as `pending`); it appears only after the owner approves it. UI strings live in `lib/i18n.ts`; content translations are `_ms` columns on `ministries`/`initiatives`, filled by `lib/translate.ts` (Claude Haiku via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`).
- **InteractiveReflection** (`app/projects/InteractiveReflection/`) — a small self-contained interactive demo (React hooks, keyboard navigation, CSS transitions). The only subproject still embedded in the portfolio; everything else was migrated out to standalone repos in May 2026 (see `docs/REPOSITORY_AUDIT.md`).

Other bits: `proxy.ts` (Next 16's middleware equivalent) refreshes the Supabase session on every request; `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` generate SEO files from `lib/site-url.ts`; light/dark/system theme is a cookie set by `app/actions/theme.ts`.

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values below
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
npm run lint                 # eslint app lib proxy.ts
npm run build                # what Vercel runs
```

Environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | yes | all Supabase clients in `lib/supabase/` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` | yes | anon/publishable key, same clients |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | only for `/admin/translations` | `lib/translate.ts` (read implicitly by the Anthropic SDK; not in `.env.example`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | no | `lib/site-url.ts`; falls back to `VERCEL_URL`, then `http://localhost:3000` |

You can run the public site and admin reads with just the two Supabase variables. Writes require signing in as `ADMIN_EMAIL`.

## Data and migrations

All application data lives in the hosted Supabase project (schema `public`): `projects`, `sprints`, `tasks`, `ministries`, `initiatives`, `submissions`. Project cards on the home page are simply rows in `public.projects`; `image_url` is an optional path to a screenshot under `public/screenshots/<slug>.png` (referenced as `/screenshots/<slug>.png`), falling back to a gradient header when null.

Conventions for `supabase/migrations/`:

- Every change is a timestamped SQL file (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_snake_case_title.sql`) and is applied to the hosted project via the Supabase CLI (`supabase db push`, config in `supabase/config.toml`) or the SQL editor. There is no local Postgres in the loop.
- Schema and *content* both go through migrations. Card copy, sprint/task status updates, and even bookkeeping notes ("SBMP migrated out", "MyQuiza live-verified") are committed as `update public.projects ...` / `update public.tasks ...` files, so the git history doubles as a changelog.
- Files are idempotent where practical (`if not exists`, `drop policy if exists`, `where status <> 'done'`) and carry a header comment explaining the why.
- RLS is the security boundary: public `select` policies, owner-email `insert/update/delete` policies. If the owner email ever changes, update `lib/auth.ts` and add a migration that recreates the policies (see `20260519130000_update_admin_email.sql`).

`types/supabase.d.ts` holds the generated database types.

## Deployment

Hosted on Vercel; every push to `main` auto-deploys to https://taufik.vercel.app. Set the environment variables above in the Vercel project (only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is secret). Supabase Auth redirect URLs for production and localhost are listed in `supabase/config.toml` and must match the hosted project's Auth settings.
